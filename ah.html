                                    Section 504 of the Americans with Disabilities Act defines a disability as a
                                    physical impairment, which substantially
                                    limits one or major life activities, for ex: breathing, speaking, seeing, walking,
                                    learning, working or taking care of
                                    oneself. Even if others do not perceive you as having such impairment, you may have
                                    a disability. The key here is the
                                    term substantially limits. This means a person is restricted as to the condition or
                                    manner, or duration under which a
                                    major life activity can be performed, in comparison to the average person or to most
                                    people, or that a person cannot
                                    perform the activity at all.

                                    Accommodations can be made for a physical and/or learning disability. A request for

                                    weeks before the beginning of the semester. Appropriate documentation of a
                                    disability must be submitted before
                                    accommodations can be arranged. Services include, but are not limited to: career

                                        Accommodation memos will be printed out. It is the student's responsibility to

                                        pick up their memo.

                                        The Student must then personally deliver the memo to each of their instructors.
                                        It is best to do this during his or her
                                        office hours. Accommodations do not become effective until the instructor
                                        receives the memo.

                                        <strong>Leave & Absences</strong> - Students must be allowed to take time
                                        off of school for pregnancy, childbirth, miscarriage, abortion and/or
                                        recovery for as long as their doctor says is medically necessary. That could
                                        mean a few absences for necessary medical appointments, or a longer leave of
                                        absence for a high-risk pregnancy or childbirth. This rule applies even if
                                        taking medically necessary leave would require an absence for longer than
                                        the school's leave policy ordinarily allows. Students cannot be penalized
                                        for taking leave and must be able to return to school in the same status
                                        they held before taking leave.

                                        <strong>Make Up Work</strong> - Professors may require you to complete
                                        missed
                                        assignments or other work to make up for missed participation, but the
                                        make-up work should be comparable with the work given to other students, not
                                        extra. When setting timelines for make-up or missed work, professors need to
                                        treat leave as leave; for example, assignment deadlines should not be the
                                        day you return. This means at least the same amount of time as other
                                        students, even beyond the semester schedule if necessary.

                                        <strong>Participation Grades/Credits</strong> - If a teacher's grading is
                                        based in part on class attendance or participation, the student should be
                                        allowed to earn the credits she missed so that she can be reinstated to the
                                        status she had before the leave.

                                        <strong>Doctor's Note</strong> - If your professor requires other students
                                        who have “excused” absences to provide a doctor's note, they can ask you to
                                        provide one as well. Be sure your doctor clearly states that the absence
                                        is/was medically necessary.

                                        <strong>Financial Aid</strong> - Taking leave may have an impact on your
                                        student loans, depending on your registration status during your time off.
                                        Schools cannot terminate or reduce merit or need-based scholarships because

                                        Be sure to meet with the financial aid office before taking any extended

                                        particular situation.<br>

                                        <strong>Admissions</strong> - Schools can't require a pregnant student to
                                        produce a doctor's note in order to stay in school or participate in

                                        all students being treated by a doctor. Schools cannot presume that a
                                        pregnant student is unable to attend school or participate in school

                                        Employees, students, or associated third parties cannot discourage your
                                        participation in the school's programs.

                                        <strong>Breastfeeding</strong> - Lamar Institute of Technology is pleased to
                                        provide a Lactation Room in the Eagle's Nest to meet the needs of parents
                                        with babies. Lactation Rooms provide a private place to nurse, pump, bottle
                                        feed, and change a diaper.<br><br>
                                        If your class is scheduled when you need to nurse or pump, your absence
                                        should be excused, and you should not be penalized for your time away. This
                                        means your grade cannot be lowered due to poor attendance, you must be given
                                        the ability to make up any work missed, and you must be able to get the
                                        information you missed as well. You may need to provide a doctor's note
                                        stating that it is medically necessary for you to pump on a certain
                                        schedule.

                                    assessment or testing.

                                    Possibly. Remember that accommodations in college are assigned to give access, so
                                    they are made individually and depend on your current functional limitations.
                                    Accommodation you received in high school might not apply to your current situation.
                                    Therefore, you might be assigned some of the same accommodations and you might be
                                    accommodated in different ways. Colleges grant equal access not equal success.
