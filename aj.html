        <h3>Eagle Learning Essentials</h3>
        <p>
          Eagle Learning Essentials (ELE) is an affordable textbook rental
          program through the Barnes and Noble Bookstore. Through this program,
          students can receive required textbooks, lab manuals, access codes and
          electronic books conveniently before the first day of class.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ELE bundle will provide the needed learning materials at $14 per
          credit hour (added to your student account), saving students up to
          35-50% on the cost of course materials. The cost can be paid by
          financial aid or by the student. If a student enrolls in a payment
          plan, this charge will be included in the payment plan calculations.
          Supplies are not included in this program and will need to be
          purchased separately.
        </p>
        <p>
          LIT students are automatically enrolled in the program at the time of
          registration and will begin receiving emails about selecting their
          preferred delivery method.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="ele-content">
        <h3>How does it work?</h3>
        <h5>Register for Your Courses</h5>
        <p>

        </p>

        <h5>Verify Your Order</h5>
        <p>
          Within 30 days of the first class day, students will receive an email
          through their LIT email account directing them to verify their
          classes, provide an address to have their rental books shipped to
          them, or select the option to pick up their ELE at the Barnes and
          Noble Campus Bookstore on the Lamar University campus.
        </p>

        <h5>Receive Your Books</h5>
        <p>
          Once you confirm your order, an email notification will be sent to
          your LIT email account notifying you when your rental order will be
          ready for pick up or when it will ship. You will be required to either
          provide an address to ship your books to or you will be given the
          option to pick up your ELE at the Barnes & Noble Campus Bookstore on
          the Lamar University campus. Your email and order number will provide
          guidance on shipping information and pick-up details.

          </li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Opting out of ELE</h5>
        <p>
          The ELE bundle is designed to provide significant savings on course
          materials, but we understand that it may not be a fit for every
          student. You can compare the price of the ELE at $14 per credit hour
          to the opt out price at the
          <a href="https://lit.bncollege.com/" target="_blank"
            >lit.bncollege.com</a
          >. If you do not wish to participate in the ELE program, you must opt
          out each semester. Students may opt-out or opt back in as many times
          as desired during the opt-out period and through the same opt-out
          link. No adjustments will be made to the ELE charges on your account
          until after the final opt-out date. In classes with digital materials,
          if students have opted out of the program, they will often have access
          to the digital material for a short-term period, for example, two
          weeks. After that free trial ends, students who have opted out will
          lose access. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the student who
          opts out to purchase access to that digital material for their use
          after the free access period ends.
        </p>
        <h5>The deadlines for opting out each semester are as follows</h5>
        <p>Fall 2024</p>
        <ul>
          <li>1st 8-week course - September 3, 2024</li>
          <li>16-week course - September 11, 2024</li>
          <li>Late Start - October 3, 2024</li>
          <li>2nd 8-week course - October 28, 2024</li>
        </ul>

          bookstore and their student account will be charged.
        </p>

        <h5>If I never pick up my books, will I still get charged?</h5>
        <p>

          If course materials have been picked up or delivered for the dropped
          class, those materials should be returned to the bookstore within 48
