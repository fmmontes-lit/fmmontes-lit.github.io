        <h3>Eagle Learning Essentials</h3>
        <p>
          Eagle Learning Essentials (ELE) is an affordable textbook rental
          program through the Barnes and Noble Bookstore. Through this program,
          students can receive required textbooks, lab manuals, access codes and
          electronic books conveniently before the first day of class.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ELE bundle will provide the needed learning materials at $14 per
          credit hour (added to your student account), saving students up to
          35-50% on the cost of course materials. The cost can be paid by
          financial aid or by the student. If a student enrolls in a payment
          plan, this charge will be included in the payment plan calculations.
          Supplies are not included in this program and will need to be
          purchased separately.
        </p>
        <p>
          LIT students are automatically enrolled in the program at the time of
          registration and will begin receiving emails about selecting their
          preferred delivery method.
        </p>

        <h3>How does it work?</h3>
        <h5>Register for Your Courses</h5>
        <p>
          Upon registering for courses, you will be automatically enrolled in
          the ELE rental access program.
        </p>

        <h5>Verify Your Order</h5>
        <p>
          Within 30 days of the first class day, students will receive an email
          through their LIT email account directing them to verify their
          classes, provide an address to have their rental books shipped to
          them, or select the option to pick up their ELE at the Barnes and
          Noble Campus Bookstore on the Lamar University campus.
        </p>

        <h5>Receive Your Books</h5>
        <p>
          Once you confirm your order, an email notification will be sent to
          your LIT email account notifying you when your rental order will be
          ready for pick up or when it will ship. You will be required to either
          provide an address to ship your books to or you will be given the
          option to pick up your ELE at the Barnes & Noble Campus Bookstore on
          the Lamar University campus. Your email and order number will provide
          guidance on shipping information and pick-up details.

        <h5>Opting out of ELE</h5>
        <p>
          The ELE bundle is designed to provide significant savings on course
          materials, but we understand that it may not be a fit for every
          student. You can compare the price of the ELE at $14 per credit hour
          to the opt out price at the [BOOKSTORE LINK]. If you do not wish to
          participate in the ELE program, you must opt out each semester.
          Students may opt-out or opt back in as many times as desired during
          the opt-out period and through the same opt-out link. No adjustments
          will be made to the ELE charges on your account until after the final
          opt-out date. In classes with digital materials, if students have
          opted out of the program, they will often have access to the digital
          material for a short-term period, for example, two weeks. After that
          free trial ends, students who have opted out will lose access.
          Therefore, it is the responsibility of the student who opts out to
          purchase access to that digital material for their use after the free
          access period ends.
        </p>
        <h5>The deadlines for opting out each semester are as follows</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Fall 2024 -</li>
          <li>Winter 2024 -</li>
          <li>Spring 2025 -</li>
        </ul>
