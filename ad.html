                    <h3>How do you define a disability?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Section 504 of the Americans with Disabilities Act defines a disability as a physical
                        impairment,
                        which
                        substantially
                        limits one or major life activities, for ex: breathing, speaking, seeing, walking, learning,
                        working
                        or taking
                        care
                        of oneself. Even if others do not perceive you as having such impairment, you may have a
                        disability.
                        The key
                        here is the term substantially limits. This means a person is restricted as to the condition
                        or
                        manner, or
                        duration
                        under which a major life activity can be performed, in comparison to the average person or
                        to most
                        people, or
                        that a
                        person cannot perform the activity at all.

                        Accommodations can be made for a physical and/or learning disability. A request for services
                        must be
                        made at
                        least
                        four weeks before the beginning of the semester. Appropriate documentation of a disability
                        must be
                        submitted
                        before
                        accommodations can be arranged. Services include, but are not limited to: career

                        <li><strong>Leave &amp; Absences</strong> - Students must be allowed to take time off of
                            school for
                            pregnancy,
                            childbirth, miscarriage, abortion and/or recovery for as long as their doctor says is
                            medically
                            necessary.
                            That
                            could mean a few absences for necessary medical appointments, or a longer leave of
                            absence for a
                            high-risk
                            pregnancy or childbirth. This rule applies even if taking medically necessary leave
                            would
                            require an absence
                            for
                            longer than the school&rsquo;s leave policy ordinarily allows. Students cannot be
                            penalized for
                            taking leave
                            and
                            must be able to return to school in the same status they held before taking leave.</li>
                        <br />
                        <li><strong>Make Up Work</strong> - Professors may require you to complete missed
                            assignments or
                            other work to
                            make
                            up for missed participation, but the make-up work should be comparable with the work
                            given to
                            other
                            students,
                            not extra. When setting timelines for make-up or missed work, professors need to treat
                            leave as
                            leave; for
                            example, assignment deadlines should not be the day you return. This means at least the
                            same
                            amount of time
                            as
                            other students, even beyond the semester schedule if necessary.</li>
                        <br />
                        <li><strong>Participation Grades/Credits</strong> - If a teacher&#39;s grading is based in
                            part on
                            class
                            attendance
                            or participation, the student should be allowed to earn the credits she missed so that
                            she can
                            be reinstated
                            to
                            the status she had before the leave.</li>
                        <br />
                        <li><strong>Doctor&#39;s Note</strong> - If your professor requires other students who have
                            &ldquo;excused&rdquo;
                            absences to provide a doctor&#39;s note, they can ask you to provide one as well. Be
                            sure your
                            doctor
                            clearly
                            states that the absence is/was medically necessary.</li>
                        <br />
                        <li><strong>Financial Aid</strong> - Taking leave may have an impact on your student loans,
                            depending on your
                            registration status during your time off. Schools cannot terminate or reduce merit or
                            need-based
                            scholarships
                            because of pregnancy.<br />
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Be sure to meet with the financial aid office before taking any extended absence and ask
                            about
                            your
                            financial
                            aid status for details about your particular situation.<br />

                        <li><strong>Admissions</strong> - Schools can&#39;t require a pregnant student to produce a
                            doctor&#39;s note in
                            order to stay in school or participate in activities, unless the same requirement to
                            obtain a
                            doctor&#39;s
                            note
                            applies to all students being treated by a doctor. Schools cannot presume that a
                            pregnant
                            student is unable
                            to
                            attend school or participate in school activities.<br />
                            <br />
                            Employees, students, or associated third parties cannot discourage your participation in
                            the
                            school&#39;s

                        <li><strong>Breastfeeding</strong> - Lamar Institute of Technology is pleased to provide a
                            Lactation
                            Room in the

                            If your class is scheduled when you need to nurse or pump, your absence should be
                            excused, and
                            you should
                            not be
                            penalized for your time away. This means your grade cannot be lowered due to poor
                            attendance,
                            you must be

                    <p>
                        A Displaced Homemaker is an individual who is considered to be the homemaker of the family
                        and is
                        forced into
                        the
                        workplace due to divorce, death or injury of a spouse who was the income provider for the
                        family.
                        The Special
                        Populations office regularly refers Displaced Homemakers to surrounding community agencies
